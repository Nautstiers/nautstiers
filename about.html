	<p><h2>NautsTiers: A tool to create and share your own flat and dual axes tier lists.</h2></p>
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
	<p><h3>What is NautsTiers?</h3></p>
	<p>NautsTiers is a webtool created so you can easily illustrate your opinion on the current Awesomenauts tier standings. Currently there are two versions, the Flat Tier List and the Dual-Axes Tier List.</p>

	<p><h3>The Flat Tier List</h3></p>
	<p>The Flat Tier List is ment to give a quick and broad overview of the distribution of power between the different Awesomenauts. It's easy to create and easy to read and can be used to sketch a general image of power.</p>

	<p><h3>The Dual Axes Tier List</h3></p>
	<p>The Dual Axes Tier List allows players to give a more detailed position to all Awesomenauts characters, based on maps, leagues etc. By combining power with reliability you get a more accurate overview of the overall potential of characters. </p>

	<p><h3>Powerful and Weak vs Reliable and Unreliable</h3>
	</p>
	<p>What makes a powerful and reliable naut such as Froggy G different from a powerful and unreliable naut such as Sentry? Basically the answer is the chance of success. Sentry is a naut whoms power decreases drastically when he faces his unfavourable matchups. The more counters you have, the more unreliable you become. Maps should also be taken into account for reliability. Gnaw might be great on Ribbit IV, yet he's not that impressive on Sorona. Reliable nauts can perform well in any given situation, unreliable nauts cannot. </p>

	<p><h3>The Sharing System</h3>
	</p>
	<p>The sharing system of the Dual-Axes Tier List is developed by KNGRichard. You can use it by simply copying the link that appears underneath 'SHARE' in the white box, after you have created your own tier list. </p>

	<p><h3>Work in Progress:</h3>

<p>The ideas below are not guaranteed to happen, it are mere ideas as of now:</p>
<p>- Adding the ability to drag characters between others in the Flat Tier List.</p>
<p>- Adding a sharing system to the Flat Tier List. </p>
<p>- Adding a database which automatically calculates average tier standings</p>
<p>- Adding a 'Comunity Tierlist' page portraying the current perception of the (forum) community on tier standings. (Basically this would be the average calculated with the database)</p>
<p>- Adding an 'Official Tierlist' page portraying the current competitive perception on tier standings. (This is tricky though, because which players would you ask to make this list and why these?)</p>
